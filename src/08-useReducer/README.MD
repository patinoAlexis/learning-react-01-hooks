# reducer on react
it looks like a reducer is just a way to manage a certain object/array
that is "complicated", with a lot of values or variables inside, so we
can put all the logic inside a single place of how you should work
with that specific part.

useReducer is mainly a replacement to useReact when the above part applies
and the code object/array is just more complicated a needs more logic
with every update.
